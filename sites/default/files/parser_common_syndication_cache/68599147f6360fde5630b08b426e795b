Thank you all for being a part of it! I will be making keepsakes out of the posts and emails and saving them in the baby book for Firecracker to read one day.<br /><br />As you all know, we chose to have a home birth for many reasons, and I still feel that I enjoyed most of the beauty that comes with a home birth. For around 37 hours (actually longer but who's counting), I labored in our home (around 44 hours labor total), free as a bird to roam from room to room, to eat what I wanted, to rest when I could, to shower for as long as the hot water heater could take it. I peeled clothes on and off, I knelt, squatted, laid and bounced wherever a contraction hit me. All be it very slowly...my body was allowed to do the work that it needed to do to bring Firecracker into this world. The contrast with the hospital is often that you are hooked-up to a fetal monitor and not allowed to move around with each contraction or to even eat or drink anything at all! Instead of being hooked up to a monitor or confined to a bed that whole time, I joyfully experienced the beauty, pain and emotion of labor at home and with Erik there for every breath.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9eTaWH_uI/AAAAAAAAApU/mdKS0ouksnw/s1600-h/cimg5119.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9eTaWH_uI/AAAAAAAAApU/mdKS0ouksnw/s320/cimg5119.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359105769176825570" border="0" /></a><br />While it's still a little unclear what happened, essentially I dialated all the way to 7-8cm (need to dialate to 10 for birth), but then when I was checked next, I had gone back down to 5cm and my cervix had significant swelling (bad news as my midwife put it). The choices were few given that we were exhausted and the contractions were intensifying. Intense contractions are usually a sign that you're close, but in my case, they had been that way for the last 12 hours. It was becoming increasingly hard to eat (and I was throwing up everything I touched), and the midwife's exams revealed that the baby was pretty tired after so many hours of contractions (not good that neither of us were getting calories). So laboring at home much longer was not really an option. Upon hearing the news, Erik and I had a very emotional moment of surrendering to what needed to be done. He bathed me in affection as we cried and he told me I had been strong and it was ok. At the suggestion of my midwife, we labored another 45 minutes at home at many different "stations" she had set up for us to try out different positions. And then after no change, we accepted the next step.<br /><br />So then it was time to prepare for a "transport" to the hospital. We ran around gathering the things we needed, blowing candles out and preparing the house to be empty for a couple of days. People had shown up that I didn't even know where in the house, and they were just in time! We needed all the support and help we could get and they were amazing. The rest was just like the movies. I had a very painful car ride to the hospital, and for all I knew, Jesus was driving and we were headed for New York City - in other words, I was OUT of it. As I slowly neglected my home birthing pain techniques (to basically meditate through contractions and relax the body), I began to tense up with every contraction, feeling helpless and like there was no mercy. Oh, and did I mention that I had extreme back labor this whole time? I still have bruises and dry patches on my back from begging Erik to pound my back. "MY BACK!", I would yell. Anyway, once we got to the hospital, I seem to remember being wheeled up to labor and delivery on someone's desk chair...? And then I remember being tranpsorted to a wheel chair and rushed off to my room. I'm telling you, it was just like the movies. There really was no emergency at that point (nor had there been for 37 hours), but I guess that's how they react to people in intense pain, and I guess they handle it like that in case there is an emergency (but we had called them in advance and told them the situation - they were expecting us).<br /><br />Then I was checked into a room, put in a hospital gown and hooked up to a monitor. At this point, my contractions were so intense  I thought they were lasting 20 mins at a time. For the first time through the whole labor, I was literally screaming out in pain, not trying to control it anymore. It's funny how much will power one can lose when they know the pain could be relieved at any moment (which was not an option at home). My sisters supported my weight as my knees buckled and they swayed my hips from side to side. Later I learned that the contractions seemed 20 minutes long because they were only 1 min apart - the first regulated contractions I had the whole time (the others were less consistent). With that news, we hoped that I was dialating faster now, but an exam revealed that I was still a mere 5 cm. In my weakness, I was posed with my options. Basically I could have a shot of pitocin, which is a synthetic hormone that makes your contractions come quicker and stronger - generally not something you can handle without an epidural. I could still try to deliver naturally, but most likely the pitocin would make it completely unbearable and I would end up exhausted and with a C-section. OR, I could take the most likely route to a vaginal birth: have a shot of pitocin, have an epidural to deal with the expressed dialation, and then deliver vaginally.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9frstkgMI/AAAAAAAAApc/3kgZ-pvDRWI/s1600-h/cimg5130.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9frstkgMI/AAAAAAAAApc/3kgZ-pvDRWI/s320/cimg5130.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359107285935489218" border="0" /></a><br />I did the latter. I was administered an epidural after about an hour (it only worked on half my body...), and then the pitocin. The lack of food and all the drugs made me sick to my stomach. I dry-heaved into mauve plastic bedpans as I shook violently from the exhaustion. But I was very happy inside, knowing that Firecracker was close. Michael Jackson's memorial service played silently on the TV above as I braced through the contractions I felt on half of my body. The next exam revealed I had dialated to 6cm, and then to a 7cm. Not long after that exam, I told Erik to go get the nurse because I felt a tremendous amount of pressure "coming down". When she came back and did the exam, she surprised me by saying that it was time to have the baby! So after around 7 hours of labor in the hospital (and around 37 at home), it was finally time to push. I had heard that women with epidurals sometimes had to push for hours, so I half-seriously asked if there was time for a nap first, but the arrival of the delivery table told me no.<br /><br />Little Stella (full name Cathey Estelle) was born at 10:16pm after just a short time of pushing. The gender was a surprise all the way up to delivery at which point the Dr. held her up in front of me and said something like, "Well, you didn't want me to tell you what it was - do you have a guess?" Our family and friends were soon let into the delivery room even as I was being sewn up (I had an internal laceration, but no episiotomy!), and it was so joyous to share this event with them right away.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9lZTZUEzI/AAAAAAAAAp0/E1F5pm2c1E8/s1600-h/cimg5148.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9lZTZUEzI/AAAAAAAAAp0/E1F5pm2c1E8/s320/cimg5148.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359113566971761458" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9lZAyhByI/AAAAAAAAAps/c_cf-i1Ur3g/s1600-h/cimg5144.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9lZAyhByI/AAAAAAAAAps/c_cf-i1Ur3g/s320/cimg5144.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359113561977194274" border="0" /></a>Erik never left her side.<br /><br /></div><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9lZlPj7wI/AAAAAAAAAp8/K85l0o1nQTo/s1600-h/cimg5150.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9lZlPj7wI/AAAAAAAAAp8/K85l0o1nQTo/s320/cimg5150.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359113571762695938" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9igJMY9II/AAAAAAAAApk/sJUzQVh-gEU/s1600-h/fampic.jpeg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 221px; height: 166px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9igJMY9II/AAAAAAAAApk/sJUzQVh-gEU/s320/fampic.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359110385957401730" border="0" /></a><br />The rest of our hospital stay was really lovely with lots of care and support pouring in from family and friends that visited daily, bringing us food and comfort. Before I even transferred to my recovery room, it was filled with flowers, comfortable pillows and bedding for Erik and delicious snacks for in between hospital meals. Thank you Michele, Lara and Ravyn for all of that!<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9pfTXAgAI/AAAAAAAAAqU/Qzzbo7-HkCs/s1600-h/cimg5172.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9pfTXAgAI/AAAAAAAAAqU/Qzzbo7-HkCs/s320/cimg5172.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359118068087816194" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9pfNNrnxI/AAAAAAAAAqM/jZylJGK872U/s1600-h/cimg5157.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9pfNNrnxI/AAAAAAAAAqM/jZylJGK872U/s320/cimg5157.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359118066438086418" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9peqag0dI/AAAAAAAAAqE/b5VvoeMDuSk/s1600-h/cimg5161.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9peqag0dI/AAAAAAAAAqE/b5VvoeMDuSk/s320/cimg5161.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359118057096663506" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Thank you to all that worried on our behalf and anxiously waited for updates - we didn't mean to stress anyone out :) Our laboring at home was incredibly safe and we were in excellent hands and care the whole time. There is really no explanation as to why my cervix got "hung up", so I feel we did what we had to and I really loved every minute of our experience. It's almost like we had the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Now we are enjoying getting to know our little girl at home. She has a very sweet disposition and is nothing but precious all day and night. I have never been filled with so much joy. Now I understand the love of a parent - an emotion so strong it brings tears to your eyes for no reason at all. With every little wince of pain she has, my heart breaks in two, and with every little happy noise, my heart breaks in two. We just adore her and feel incredibly fortunate to have her and to have each other.<br /><br />Thanks again for the love and support. I loved hearing the updates through labor that our friends and family on the list were sending love and supportive messages the whole time! It really makes a difference to have that kind of support.<br /><br />We love you all and can't wait for you to meet her!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9pzmxf5nI/AAAAAAAAAqc/QHvN0squwK8/s1600-h/cimg5209.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9pzmxf5nI/AAAAAAAAAqc/QHvN0squwK8/s320/cimg5209.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359118416896583282" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9qEPTDz2I/AAAAAAAAAqk/ll7Vd3m3ydA/s1600-h/cimg5213.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Sl9qEPTDz2I/AAAAAAAAAqk/ll7Vd3m3ydA/s320/cimg5213.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359118702652673890" border="0" /></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-6587027897177405455?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1247593440;s:12:"original_url";s:60:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/07/birth-story.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-6587027897177405455";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:11:"In Labor...";s:11:"description";s:231:"...since 3:30am.<br /><br />Love you all :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-3988888152290502691?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1246898520;s:12:"original_url";s:57:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/07/in-labor.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-3988888152290502691";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:7:"Overdue";s:11:"description";s:3094:"So I am officially overdue. Aside from one day when she wasn't so sure, my midwife always said she thought I'd see my due date. And sure enough, it came and went.<br /><br />Not only did I not anticipate that I'd go into labor today, but I barely thought about it. Only a couple of times did Erik and I mention it to each other (mainly in the form of, "Happy Due Date!"). I did mention it to one stranger in a restaurant when her daughter commented that I was wearing a dress and had a big baby "in there". When her mom said her daughter's comments were sometimes embarrassing when she was wrong, I assured her that she was right this time and that the baby was "big" because it is due today. I should have known that would get a "WOW!" - didn't even cross my mind that it would shock her. Maybe it should shock me more...? Somehow I am calmer than what's usually expected...? Nervous about labor but not anxious about when...? I don't know. What can I say?<br /><br />My plan for the 4th of July was to avoid the festive chaos that I usually adore in effort to not get stuck in a crowd or traffic should labor start. We slept in, had brunch, went to the store, saw friends, went out for dinner, had dessert and coffee afterwards. And as we were driving home to turn in and settle for the night, we saw some fireworks in the sky that prompted my man's suggestion, "Let's just drive around a little and find some to watch from the car." "Totally", I agreed. We stop home, pee and fill a big plastic cup with decaf iced tea. Instead of just finding "some fireworks", we drive toward downtown just to see if we can see them from the upper deck of the freeway. We can't, so we drive closer and closer to the big downtown display until suddenly we see them bursting between skyscrapers, and we quickly exit the freeway to find a side street on which to turn and hideout and watch them. Little did we know it was a vein straight to the fireworks with a completely-stopped line of traffic sitting directly under the colorful explosions. We excitedly rolled down our windows to hear the repeated boom, and happily sat in standstill traffic as we watched the fireworks closer than we had seen them in years. After sitting at the same light and watching it change probably 35 times, the grand finale happened, and we quickly flipped a bitch and headed back to the freeway with no problem at all. We laughed at having spent a day purposefully avoiding downtown and traffic just to end up in exactly that.<br /><br />Though we went to bed hours ago now, I am still up with many contractions and an insanely active baby. Given that my two guesses have always been June 28 or July 5, I REALLY just want to sleep right now and be prepared for what may come. But no, Firecracker is apparently like its mother and loooooves to stay up late and looooves the 4th of July too much to go to sleep now. So here we are. July 5th.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-6905808481175249248?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1246774260;s:12:"original_url";s:56:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/07/overdue.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-6905808481175249248";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:16:"The Home Stretch";s:11:"description";s:10489:"Firecracker is due on Saturday.<br /><br />Someone asked me yesterday what I was doing for the holiday, and I was like, "What holiday?" Though Firecracker has been due on the 4th of July this whole time, I had completely forgotten that the weekend would be full of people leaving town and/or celebrating with flags, hot dogs, watermelon and fireworks.<br /><br />The 4th of July is one of my favorite holidays. Usually by this time, I am flipping through recipes and planning on making some kind of ultra cheesy cake with a flag on it made of blueberries and strawberries. I am never one to shy away from loading up a cooler and going into the worst crowd so that I can watch fireworks and eat unhealthy food and listen to live music. I love the smell of bug spray and beer in a fireworks-awaiting crowd, and I love the look on children's faces as they wait in anticipation for the big show, eating Popsicle after Popsicle to stay cool and interested.<br /><br />DC was, of course, an amazing place to see the fireworks. At some point, we ended up trading the crowds for rooftop views from our tall apartment buildings. While it was always fun, I always missed the chaos of the National Mall and walking all the way home in a mass crowd because the subways were too packed. Being back in Austin, I wonder what we will opt for with kids in tow. I will certainly drag the family down to Zilker Park or Auditorium Shores for several years so that we can see great live music and eat roasted corn and BBQ while we wait for fireworks. But I'm sure we will also have some years where we go to Grandpa Chuck's out in the Hill Country to do sparklers and watermelon and to take it easy. Or maybe we'll go out on the lake and watch the fireworks from a boat. If Firecracker isn't here by the 4th, we may be going to Grandpa Chuck's this year.<br /><br />It's crazy to start envisioning the traditions we will form for our kids. For some reason, it really excites me.<br /><br />For now, Firecracker is happily content to stay put another day.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Skj-dXRAzdI/AAAAAAAAAos/1WZwVdiNyB4/s1600-h/cimg4996.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Skj-dXRAzdI/AAAAAAAAAos/1WZwVdiNyB4/s320/cimg4996.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352807937544867282" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Skj-csa-nHI/AAAAAAAAAok/u_1oXtws6GU/s1600-h/cimg4988.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Skj-csa-nHI/AAAAAAAAAok/u_1oXtws6GU/s320/cimg4988.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352807926043942002" border="0" /></a>And then there are the contractions that make me wonder how content...<br /></div><br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Skj8aRhbMhI/AAAAAAAAAn8/zsUcCcbzOII/s1600-h/cimg5002.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/Skj8aRhbMhI/AAAAAAAAAn8/zsUcCcbzOII/s320/cimg5002.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352805685440229906" border="0" /></a>So we are trying to be ready!

Not only did they give me precious copies of pictures from the work we've done together - pictures I didn't have - and copies of photos of us together, but they also took several new ones with everyone in the office, all with a special message just for me. They also included pictures of DC landmarks that I adore, and of my old neighborhood - Dupont Circle - a place that was like an identity to me. I am so touched by the time that was taken to do this very labor-intensive project. To have these memories all in one place, and to have new ones made on my behalf leaves me speechless.<br /><br />Sometimes work is work, and when you leave a job, it's just goodbye. But I really did leave a small family behind, and I am just so touched by how much they care about me and how much they've done and still do for me. It makes all the difference when people just take the time to let you know how much your loved. I feel so incredibly loved, and I feel like this baby has a welcoming committee that stretches from coast-to-coast - a safety net of people that is reinforced by SO much love!<br /><br />A deep thank you to my family and friends at CWLA!!! I hope you are all still there when I send Firecracker to DC to do an internship :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-8400941739555723000?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1246200420;s:12:"original_url";s:66:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/06/from-dc-with-love.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-8400941739555723000";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:9:"Dear Baby";s:11:"description";s:9485:"Lately I have felt the urge to write Firecracker a letter (as if the baby isn't sick of hearing my thoughts all day long already). For those of you that have seen the movie, The Waitress, you'll laugh at how every time I try in my head, it starts off, "Dear Dumb Baby,". OMG what a great movie.<br /><br />So here goes.<br /><br />Dear Firecracker,<br /><br />According to a somewhat arbitrary arrival prediction, you may be here for real in less than two weeks. You can't imagine the different emotions that have surrounded your impending arrival. Your parents can't quite imagine just what to expect, and the world has felt at liberty to comment on your "appearance" and your plausible behavior. As I've told your dad, pregnancy seems to be the one thing I've experienced where the human race feels the urge and the right to comment on and give unsolicitated advice toward our care of you or what to expect from you: "You take care of that baby now - it's just another little person in there, just like you!" and "You're having a girl, I can tell! Get ready - she will give you hell and break your heart!".<br /><br />While sometimes these comments can be condescending (like when people say that I'd better prepare because I look like I'm going to pop any day, as if I haven't been preparing for 9 months...), I still listen with fascination at the interest that all people of all backgrounds and color have shown in your existence and arrival. It's truly the only time that I've experienced such blatant public acknowledgement about anything happening in my life. And mostly, I am glad that they understand how big of a deal it is - they get it. It feels like people as a whole are trying to prepare me for bringing another person into this hugely tangled colorful family known as the human race. Your arrival is truly the one thing I've experienced to be fully common and universal. Simply put and overly said, it's how we all got here (so you think we'd be less fascinated with it by now..._).<br /><br />You will finally get to meet a voice that has been talking to you for several months now. Melanie, our midwife, gently feels for your head and body every week and listens to your heartones. You "run" from the doppler, perhaps because of the heat it puts off or the sound of your heart that it amplifies out to us - something that never gets old and is just as fascinating every time as it was the first. Melanie predicted earlier on that you would be right on schedule if not late, but her thoughts are changing now. After an unexpected visit to see her the other night from what we thought might be "leaking waters", she thinks you've dropped quite a bit and may be headed for the big trip sooner than thought before.<br /><br />Given her new assessment, we should probably decide on a name for you but we haven't yet. We're not expecting that you'll come out and look like a "this" or a "that", but it's just that we're (I'm) not sure yet. Maybe it will be a nice distraction to think about when I am bringing you into the world (and hopefully you won't have a curse word for a name).<br /><br />And speaking of names, I changed my name this week to match the part of your name that I do know - your last name. While I always intended to take your daddy's last name (well, kind of...), I somehow never got around to it. So now I have a very long middle name since I've chosen to keep my original middle name AND to also make my maiden name my middle name. So now we will all have the same last name - my only goal. You can thank us later that we didn't hyphenate two very long last names...<br /><br />I can tell you that most parents start off with big hopes for their child - a hope that they'll be happy, and a hope that life will be better for their child than it was for them. While I don't want to walk into parenting with expectations for how you'll turn out or what you'll do with your life, I do hope that we'll be able to provide you with enough guidance and freedom to navigate your way with confidence and security. I hope that you'll always find a friend in your parents and that you'll never be afraid to tell us anything no matter how bad. I hope you'll be comfortable in your own skin, never second-guessing who you are and always being true to yourself. These hopes may sound cliché, but they are my dreams for you.<br /><br />Your Grandma Cathey (my mom) passed away unexpectedly when you were just a 14-week old fetus. When she passed, I reflected on all of the hopes that she surely had as she held me as an infant. Some of those hopes never happened for her, and now I can relate to what it's like to have the strongest hopes and desires for something completely out of your control. And while it hasn't happened to me, I can feel the pain she felt everytime one of her dreams for me was crushed. It's a scary reconing.<br /><br />Your grandma was so excited to meet you. Just two days before she died, we shopped together and she bought you a few things that I will make sure you have. She also gave me her silver baby spoon, something I treasure so much and hope that you will, too. As I am your mother, she was my mother - she's a part of me that will never die, and she lives on in you.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what traits you receive of your father's. His eyes? His kindness? His patience? Your dad sings a song to you every night that lights up his face and makes you move like crazy. You will come to know his gentle eyes and smile and kisses, and just like me, you will crave his warm embraces. Right now he works from home and is with us all day long - I hope this never changes.<br /><br />In order to protect your health (and the environment), we are doing the not-completely-but-increasingly-common cloth diaper-thing (you wouldn't believe how complicated...Fuzzi Bunz vs. Bum Genius vs....). Your "wipes" will be rags dipped in a home-made solution (vs. disposable wipes). And we are trying to buy most things organic for you. You will hopefully (if all goes well) be breast-fed from day one (and my diet will hopefully be as organic as we can afford...). Unfortunately, they have not come out with a better asthma drug that isn't Class C, so I desperately hope your are not being poisoned (I tried to go without it...which ended up being the not-breathing choice).<br /><br />At this point in history, gay people cannot get married in this country as a whole. Our nation is still fighting a war in Iraq. We recently elected our first black President. Gas is almost $3/gallon (in Texas) and going up steadily. We are in an official recession, something both of my grandmas have commented to be as bad as the Depression era through which they lived. Corn syrup and bad agricultural policy from the 70's have wreaked havoc on our nation's health, but natural and organic foods straight from the farm are back on the rise. A serious realization about climate change has finally occurred (in America), and more friendly and sustainable resources are making their way into our American lives, like sheets made of bamboo and biodegradable plastic. We drive my grandma's 2001 Toyota Corolla that gets about 28 miles/gallon (we just put your carseat in it tonight and it barely fits!).  Healthcare is a total and complete national crisis with millions of children being uninsured (and drug companies being insanely evil). It was 105 degrees in Austin today and it's not even July (I'm afraid of what's coming for your future...). I buy most of our groceries at the farmers market, but supplement with things from Whole Foods and Central Market like nuts and coffee (yes, your mother is a coffee addict). Iran is having mass riots over an election that are possibly as big as what occurred in 1979. YouTube.com is the place to be (and Facebook). Google is slowly taking over the world, as is Apple Computers (I have an iphone but your dad unfortunately sports a Blackberry for work). Your dad is a huge fan of open source software (and Microsoft is evil). For music at home, we mostly listen to Pandora.com for radio stations that we can customize, or we play music from our MP3's (CD's are still around but we got rid of them and opted to have all of our music electronically). The TV transmitter signal just made the big switch from analogue to digital. We just bought a digital video camera today (from Costco of all places) to capture all of your big milestones - the big thing about it is that it's HD. Pixar just came out with the movie, "Up", a huge breakthrough in movie-making technology (everything in 3-D). And at this very moment in time, you have the hiccups - something pretty typical.<br /><br />I hope to capture these small historical occurrences in your life as you grow so that you may one day reflect on how much the world has changed since you entered it. As much as the world has changed just since I was born, I can't imagine a bigger change in my life than you. Whatever happens from here on, and as we continue to make history together, please know that your parents have the best intentions for you in our hearts always. Have mercy on your parents when we screw up and remember that forgiveness (for anyone) and love are things that will bring you the most peace and joy.<br /><br />See you soon...<br /><br />Love,<br />Mama<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-4492189064478455119?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1245684480;s:12:"original_url";s:58:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/06/dear-baby.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-4492189064478455119";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:27:"Pregnancy "Best of" Moments";s:11:"description";s:6949:"I haven't been that great at tracking the various stages of my pregnancy (as I intended), but I'm taking a moment now to record some things that stand out to me before it's all over.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Day 1 - we find out we're pregnant! </span><br />After months of buying and wasting very expensive pregnancy tests, and getting in trouble with Erik over the expense of my anxiety (which I excused by saying that I needed to know so that I could drink wine or not), there was finally a <span style="font-style: italic;">faint</span> DOUBLE line. Just when I was positive that I was not pregnant (but testing to see if I could drink that weekend), there it was: the faint double line. However, it was a test with a very faint double line out of a box of THREE peed-on tests that were defective and showed nothing. I had taken those defective tests much earlier that morning with my precious first morning pee (it has the strongest detectable hormones), and I was very upset that the tests were defective and I had wasted precious AM pee on them. But to my surprise, without drinking water or anything, I awoke again an hour or two later with a full bladder ready for more tests! So after I gently woke Erik and broke the news that I had taken all 3 pregnancy tests (when I was not supposed to...), and that there was a faint double line on only one, it was off to CVS to buy more (with permission this time!). The more expensive tests confirmed the double line that only got darker with another try on the following day. This was it - Firecracker was on the way (and no more drinking).<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Morning Sickness Sets In</span><br />One day it was a Whataburger with everything but the meat (shake and fries included). The next, it was fried anything from Long John Silvers (as long as it had tarter sauce on it, and lots of it!). Then BBQ. Everyday. EVERY day. And Chipotle once the BBQ began to make me sick. And then I couldn't get enough Pho - noodles, noodles, noodles. And then the infamous pot of chicken soup.  Erik quickly learned that when I said I wanted something and that I wanted a HUGE quantity of it (for instance, a huge cast iron pot of chicken soup), that he should ignore my request and make  very little to nary a serving or he'd be eating it for weeks. Many beautiful greens died in our fridge trying to make it into this pregnant woman's diet... Swiss chard grave yard. Popsicles, lollipops, Pop Tarts, lemonade, ginger ale, wrist bands - NOTHING helped my morning sickness but sleep (if I could fall asleep), and sometimes the distraction of a movie. But the more sour and cold a food/drink was, the better. I think I stopped by Casey's Sno Cones everyday for months, waiting for them to open for the spring so that I could have a lemon sno cone. Once they opened, I never went back. Such is the life-or-death pregnant craving.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Trimester</span><br />GREAT for your marriage...<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sneezing and laughing to the point of...</span><br />Peeing. It happens. Anywhere. I'll not say any more about that.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Realization of My Actual Body</span><br />Trying on a skirt at Whole Foods (yes, the original Whole Foods mother ship with clothes and all...), and seeing my whole self for one of the first times since we don't have a full length mirror at home. I hadn't done that typical pregnant-thing before where you stand naked in front of the mirror often in awe of what's happening. Instead, I did it at Target and Whole Foods (once at each place) before I quickly learned not to look in the mirror when undressing to try on clothes. I must have stood there for 5 minutes straight with my mouth wide open, not believing what had happened to the rest of my body (forget the stomach!). I still can't look at that skirt hanging up at Whole Foods.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shaving</span><br />We have what's referred to as a "weight-watchers shower", certainly not made for pregnant women. I literally have to open the shower door and stick my leg out to bend over and shave. There is barely room for me and a razor in there. Oh, and speaking of the shower, now cleaning the shower consists of me spraying it down and leaving the cleaner on it as if it will magically scrub itself. I physically cannot get in there to do it. Too bad I use all-natural cleaning products because just spraying it down with Tilex might actually work.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Erik Singing to Baby</span><br />Erik wrote a bedtime song/lullaby that he sings to Firecracker every night. While Firecracker is an active baby, the activity really raises when it hears Erik's voice. It's kind of funny to be laying there peacefully and Erik pulls up my shirt to sing and then Firecracker goes crazy, making me wince all the while. But it's so precious to see Erik's face while singing this sweet song, stroking my belly and kissing Firecracker goodnight.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Oh, Darlin'<br />If your heart grows weak,<br />As you lay alone tonight,<br />Just dream of me.<br />I'll hold you close now,<br />I'll caress your head.<br />I'll whisper my love to you,<br />As you lay in bed.<br /><br />Oh, Darlin'<br />Your mother and I,<br />We love you through and through,<br />A love never to die.<br />We wake up each morning,<br />Our hearts open anew -<br />Our love for each other<br />Only passed by our love for you.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Realization that it's Any Day Now</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(and it's really happening)</span><br />Actual excitement kind of hit me in the car for the first time the other day. You'd think that strong contractions and washing baby clothes would make my brain excited and think, "Wow, we're having a BABY!". But honestly, those things don't always make the reality click in my head. Even feeling Firecracker move and watching it roll under my skin doesn't always make it more real. It's real in that I completely expect it and I obviously know what's coming, but every great once in awhile it hits me in a different way, like I can actually experience our baby in my mind for a split second, and then it's gone. I seem to get more excited about picturing Erik as a father while also trying to hold onto this pre-father image of him that I have known so long. I've seen so many babies and kids play with him, taking his glasses off and laughing when he makes funny faces. But I've never quite been able to imagine it with his own kids until recently. So gentle, so good-natured - he will continue to blow me away.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-4598217505232811947?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1244423460;s:12:"original_url";s:74:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/06/pregnancy-best-of-moments.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-4598217505232811947";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:27:"Just around 3 Weeks Left...";s:11:"description";s:6429:"It's funny how life is moving very fast and more slowly at the same time. I guess it's more that I'm moving slowly, but our life is zooming forward. We continue to paint rooms and tear down wallpaper and prepare for Firecracker. Now that I don't have work, I start my mornings off with a walk or with a yoga DVD, trying to prepare my body for the marathon of birth (squats and stretching to build up the endurance of my muscles...uh...right, because that 45-min waddle around my neighborhood is making a difference...). I then make breakfast and tea for the <span style="font-style: italic;">three</span> of us before moving onto a major house project or running errands. Erik gets lovely black tea while I continue to drink my pick of herbal teas that either tone your uterus, fight morning sickness or heartburn, or "calm you". With the weather already in the 90's (and my belly being BIG), I move very slowly around the house and everywhere I go. But I am always on the move.<br /><br />Perhaps that is why we had another day of scary contractions. When I got home from my errands one day recently, they were 5 minutes apart and sometimes just 2 minutes apart. Nothing stopped them but a glass of wine and a little [forced] rest. I slept hard that night and could barely get up the next morning - I think my body totally forgot what wine was...  If I go into labor in the evening or middle of the night, I have orders from the midwife to drink wine so that I get some sleep before what will surely be a first-time mom labor marathon all night and the next day.<br /><br />It's possible I could go into labor any day now. Am I ready? Not at all. If we had the baby tomorrow, we'd be fine. We have enough pre-folds (early cloth diapers) and onesies to last a few days, but we are still without some things (things I am taking care of this week): diaper bag, place to change Firecracker (like a changing-table/pad-thing), a bather, etc. I think I'm in denial about how much stuff we may or may not need. I feel like parents fall into the consumer trap of thinking we need a bunch of special B.S. for a baby, when in actuality, we probably hardly need any of it. But there are a couple of obvious things that need to finally be bought by this preggo in denial.<br /><br />Am I ready mentally? Not at all. But I'm not sure I can be. It seems to be one of those things for which you just cannot actually prepare. I am still reading books about this and that (though not as much as I should be), and I'm trying to imagine both the "sensation" (pain) of natural childbirth and then being a parent FOREVER. But I don't get very far. Unless I want to have an outright anxiety attack, I try not to think about it too hard. I think for the most part that it all just happens and you just roll with the punches - you're just totally in it and don't have time to even analyze it. And then suddenly, you forget what life was ever like before. Just like when you get married or something - it's hard to remember what it was all like before.<br /><br />I'm trying to hold onto every detail of what life is like now, just like I did when I moved from DC 8 months ago. I tried to remember the smell of the air, the look on people's faces as they hurried by, the way the Capitol or Washington Monument stood majestically in the background - huge symbols that are barely noticed sometimes when you live there. I didn't want to forget what DC had done to me and how special it was. Now I'm trying not to forget what it's like to have uninterrupted thoughts, to spontaneously go to a coffee shop and read (without arranging for a babysitter), to be able to decide that I'm leaving and not have it take 30 minutes to gather a baby and everything that goes with, possibly "pausing" to nurse or calm cries on the way out. I'm holding onto the fact that I can read when I want or pop in a movie when I want. My attention is still undivided in the morning when I roll over to kiss Erik awake, bringing him to me to snuggle as he slowly rejoins the waking world, smiling and nuzzling.<br /><br />Life will not end with birth, but the experience of these things will end as I know them for many, MANY years.<br /><br />Pregnancy has been fun, and honestly, I can't complain. Of course I've had an emotional roller coaster with my mom dying, something that I cannot separate from this pregnancy or time in my life - it's just connected and I'm often unable to think about one without thinking about the other. But I have enjoyed the changes my body and mind have experienced. I haven't enjoyed the extra weight around my butt, thighs, arms, face, etc., but I've enjoyed watching a baby take over what was once a flat tummy. I enjoy my pulse throbbing through my body with the extra blood I've developed to support this other life. And I live for the quiet moments when I'm laying or sitting and Firecracker thumps around or gets the hiccups. I look down at my belly or place a hand to feel the rolling movement of this tiny being moving around in my body. There is just nothing on Earth like it. Nothing.<br /><br />It scares me to death that Firecracker is going to come out (of my body) and that we will be the sole providers and teachers. The one thing in life you can't undo is about to happen to me, but it's the most joyous, too - I realize that or I wouldn't be doing it. But it's a big deal nonetheless.<br /><br />Erik's been out of town, and while I miss him in ridiculous amounts, I have enjoyed what may be the last days and nights I ever have to myself for a long time. I've kept busy, but have reserved a couple of nights for watching movies and reading, quietly and by myself. My introverted self has always cherished extensive alone time, but now I outright worship it. That said, I can't wait for Erik to get back! What I am trying to covet most is the absolute romance we share all day and everyday as if we had just met and fallen in love. That's not going anywhere, but I'm preserving what it's like to have only one true love in my life before we both fall in love with another.<br /><br />As I finish this post, Firecracker has gotten the hiccups and seems to be quite annoyed (moving around as if to try and stop them). How it does make me smile.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-7326988674338632328?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1244060640;s:12:"original_url";s:73:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/06/just-around-3-weeks-left.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-7326988674338632328";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:12:"Baby Shower!";s:11:"description";s:9397:"My two sisters and best friend threw me an incredible baby shower.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SibbKEe88SI/AAAAAAAAAlE/iyDILXDoD80/s1600-h/cimg4930.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SibbKEe88SI/AAAAAAAAAlE/iyDILXDoD80/s320/cimg4930.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343198973970411810" border="0" /></a>My oldest sister, Michele, holding the camera (friend Jenna in the long skirt)...<br /></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SibbKudxQWI/AAAAAAAAAlU/bEbziYdgry4/s1600-h/cimg4917.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SibbKudxQWI/AAAAAAAAAlU/bEbziYdgry4/s320/cimg4917.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343198985239740770" border="0" /></a>My next oldest sister, Lara, working her butt off...<br /></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SibbKdKsfZI/AAAAAAAAAlM/Tn2m25wGJVU/s1600-h/cimg4936.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SibbKdKsfZI/AAAAAAAAAlM/Tn2m25wGJVU/s320/cimg4936.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343198980596333970" border="0" /></a>And my best friend, Ravyn.<br /></div><br /><br />The spread was really beautiful.

What happened to me (like, where did I go)? I don't know. Sort of a combination of things.<br /><br />I have had a very sad past week or so. Since my mother's death, I have gone from devastated to better (like just having crying episodes every day or so), but this past week I just can't get my mind to get on a different track. Part of it is the changing of the season. Easter and flowers remind me a lot of my mom, and everything right now is screaming Easter and spring (flowers). Texas thunderstorms and dark rolling clouds remind me of her (she loved storms), and it's been a week of nothing but. Watching dead things come back to life (spring) has always been my favorite thing. But spring forgot someone this year.<br /><br />As I am still somehow in this stage of denial (with her having died less than 3 months ago), I have not forgotten that she's gone but I still can't make my heart or mind accept it. I still almost buy a candle for her every time I see a gardenia scent. I still almost call her while I'm making dinner, the time I reserved to talk with her. She's the only one in my life that always wanted to know what I was making. And I struggle endlessly with regret over so many things, but mainly my last weekend with her. I can't express how grateful I am that I saw her two days before she died, but I have a lot of pain associated with that trip. I was a morning-sick holiday-exhausted daughter that was not cherishing the time I was spending with my mother, even if she had just gotten out of the hospital. I wish I could re-write the entire weekend; make myself the heroin that swoops in and makes it all better. But instead, she begged to get out of the hospital too early to come home and be with us (she had been there 4-5 weeks already) and I didn't cherish it. And then she died. Typical mother-daughter conflict that happened that weekend haunts me. I can't let it go. It symbolizes something much bigger than I can explain right now.<br /><br />There is a new woman that joined my grief group who's situation seems pretty similar to mine. Her mother died after a life of chronic illness, neediness and substance abuse (though she had sobered like my mom had recently). Her mom died just two weeks after my mom died. She told her painful story at the group without shedding a tear, staring at the ceiling while she spoke, still in complete shock and denial that her mother was gone. She's going through the things I went through right afterwords - horrible dreams of a funeral straight from a horror movie - dreams of the suffering that happened right before. She waits, like I did, for her mother to visit in a dream to tell her everything's OK and that she can just live her life. The bad dreams will stop, I tell her. But I'm still waiting on the latter.<br /><br />We started our new childbirth class this week, and it's funny how unused I am to a classroom/group setting that when we sat down in the circle, I immediately associated it with my grief group. I had the brief thought: thank goodness - finally a group of pregnant women that I can talk to who have lost their mothers and know how devastating it all is. But I quickly realized this was not a place to grieve the passing of others but to celebrate and prepare for the new life inside. Of course, part of my pregnant story has been about losing my mom, so I shared honestly my fear of stalling out during childbirth because of deep sadness (this happens to many women). I'm happy I'll have a place to confront these fears and to work it out (our teacher totally gets it).<br /><br />Our childbirth teacher is our neighbor - she lives just around the corner with her hip husband and precious daughters (of 8 and 6 or something?). Child art hangs everywhere and their house screams, I have been lived in and I see so much love. Their girls dance around and beg for attention from the pregnant couples, and they peak around the corner to listen to the stories their mom tells us about childbirth and how they came into the world. I have no doubt they will probably sit front and center as we watch childbirth videos as a class, right there in their living room. They enter tid-bits to their mother's stories about their births, adding, The cord was wrapped around my neck and I looked like a big blueberry-face coming out! I love how comfortable they are with the subject. I love that they are our neighbors.<br /><br />I was surprised that we are the only ones in the class having a home birth. There is a couple that's giving birth in a birthing center, but the rest are headed to the hospital. Our teacher made the mistake of saying that home birth is best, as she then had to backtrack as the class verbally took playful offense to her comment. But I was glad she said it since we're the only ones. She's had a hospital birth and a homebirth, so she would know.<br /><br />An automatic nursery appeared at our house recently. We went from having one precious blanket that I bought on Craigslist to having an entire set-up for baby. Erik's dad (who has two very young sons and lives in Italy) sent us all of the baby stuff that they recently used. It's all top-of-the-line Italian preciousness. We are eternally grateful. Soooooooo grateful. Thank you, Rick!!!!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/ScudVeDj1MI/AAAAAAAAAb4/HZNlxlh6mLk/s1600-h/CIMG4489.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;

We spent several days listening to the gory and heart-wrenching details that not only described a murder, but that also described a very broken home. As each person took the stand, their words were their truth, and their truths wrestled my brain to the ground day after day. Their personalities were animated and strong, and their faces hung in my memory long after the trial, like distant relatives I had just met at a family reunion. Each time someone took the stand, I would retrace the details as to where I had heard mention of them in earlier testimonies and how they fit into the complicated puzzle.<br /><br />Thank goodness for my co-jurors, all great people faced with the same complicated obligation. Such an interesting experience to be thrown into a group of people of all different backgrounds, ages and ethnicity, all charged with deciding the fate of a man. Not your typical group project in college. As a group, I felt we were quite lucky to have the personalities we had - we all got along for the most part, and we had a good time over drinks (hard not to do). I have a feeling that were we not in a government building and someone would have passed a joint around, we may have all stayed friends for life. They made as great an impact on me as the witnesses and the accused (and the dead). I looked forward everyday to hearing about the previous nights of my co-jurors, catching-up over coffee breaks and lunches. With the stresses in all of our lives, our [forced] time together seemed like forever at the time, but it was very short looking back. Now that I have moved away from those folks, it is a greater possibility that I will never see them again: not the new-mom broker or the landscaping dad-to-be, not the pilates chic, not the bad-ass chef/mom/restaurant-owner/writer, not the woman who dressed as if it was Halloween every day.<br /><br />I will never forget what it felt like to decide someone's fate for the worst. The 911 recording played over and over in my head as I fought the instinct that told me I had no business being there and deciding such a thing. Heavy-hearted, I remember wishing that I could confide in my closest friends (and husband) so that they could help me with this burden I had of deciding what to do. But of course we were all silenced by the law. Thankfully no other opinions could further confuse the already confusing evidence swirling in my brain. In the end, it was the faint voice of Howard Brown himself that told us what to do. After each of us listening through headphones for what seemed like 100 times, we all heard the eerie "Tony did it".<br /><br />Howard Brown, a man with a "pip in his step", someone who liked to eat pig's ears (or was it feet) when the neighbor's brought it over, someone that wasn't even close to dying - Mr. Brown fought for his life, and his grandson is paying with his life for taking the life of another. The haze of the trial and the sleepless nights finally cleared once I finally moved on from the fact that I did not ask to judge this man's life but was chosen for whatever reason. I did the very best that I could and I only hope that should I ever be in a role reversal, that my life is weighed with as much thought, contemplation and respect as was given by the jury on which I served.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-7716277448541152741?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1235884680;s:12:"original_url";s:61:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/02/howard-brown.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-7716277448541152741";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:16;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:8:"21 Weeks";s:11:"description";s:6953:"Isn't it funny how we count pregnancy and babies' ages in weeks? I never understood that until I got pregnant and quickly became aware that everything is measured in weeks because every week is so critical (in an infant's life, too). Every week there is something new and major going on that wasn't going on the week before. And the milestone weeks are the ones you wait for - 14 or so weeks may bring the hope of morning sickness' end, and 17-20 weeks brings the hope of feeling your baby move.<br /><br />Last week was the 20th week, and while I waited (bored out of my mind) in the Dr.'s waiting room (GP, not OB), I felt the first little flutters and pings of our child moving around. I was so stunned (as most women are), that I immediately held my tummy tightly with both hands and internally begged for another movement. As I stared intensely into the air, concentrating on feeling something, I felt it again and knew for sure that it wasn't gas or something else - it was the little creature inside of me, finally big enough to be felt. Talk about joy. I stared into space, grinning from ear-to-ear in a waiting room full of strangers that must have thought I was having a secret orgasm or something.<br /><br />Since then, I have felt that same feeling pretty regularly. It still feels like little flutters and "rolling" - no real major kicks yet. As my midwife calls me, I am pretty text book in terms of when I hit my milestones and how big I am. Never have I been OK with being so ordinary and not unique. But a way in which I maybe haven't been that ordinary is my lack of obsessing. Many moms by this point have experienced a lot of anxiety and emotional ups-and-downs regarding their pregnancy (miscarriage and other things). Other than my mom's death and the emotion that has surrounded that, I have been very calm and relaxed with it all (maybe too relaxed...?), and haven't really obsessed about anything. I think I am just busy enough with the house and work that I don't really focus on it so much. If anything, I expect that I'll become more and more anxious about a natural birth at home (because of the pain, nothing else), but I'm trying to be cool about it (as I read birth story after birth story about excruciating pain and women having to access their animal brain just to get through it...). Until then, I am more obsessive about finishing the house so that I can enjoy myself when the baby's born. I don't want to be holding a newborn with postpartum depression, and crying about how much I hate the wallpaper everywhere. If I didn't have like 5 rooms left to remodel and decorate, I would probably be more obsessive about my pregnancy, but who knows.<br /><br />The house is coming along well. I finally finished pulling down wallpaper in one of the bathrooms and will begin painting it soon. I have fun looking online for stuff for the baby room, but everything seems too this or that or too expensive. Hopefully the shipment of baby stuff from Erik's dad will arrive soon (he is thankfully sending us all of his baby stuff that he used with his kids) - that may help me start to figure that room out a bit. All in all, I'm having a good time decorating and figuring rooms out. It's been a little stressful with our budget, but thank goodness for garage sales, thrift stores and Craig's List - honestly, our house would be empty without those things.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SaK4F93ilfI/AAAAAAAAAYs/-4EQzApNnLI/s1600-h/CIMG4407.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SaK4F93ilfI/AAAAAAAAAYs/-4EQzApNnLI/s320/CIMG4407.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5306005723642238450" border="0" /></a>The last of the wallpaper (in this room...).<br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SaK4GL8TLSI/AAAAAAAAAY0/fHDs2Tru8ro/s1600-h/CIMG4410.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SaK4GL8TLSI/AAAAAAAAAY0/fHDs2Tru8ro/s320/CIMG4410.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5306005727420296482" border="0" /></a>Our Chinese torture tool.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SaK4GaRGbVI/AAAAAAAAAY8/YSN7qidfyKk/s1600-h/CIMG4412.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SaK4GaRGbVI/AAAAAAAAAY8/YSN7qidfyKk/s320/CIMG4412.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5306005731265637714" border="0" /></a>The pregnant contractor (boy, was she slow...).<br /><br /><br /></div>Erik will be heading out to DC next week for a long 10-day visit.

They say this is the time in between the two bad periods - the first and third trimesters can be pretty brutal (and the first was). But as a record, I will mention the couple of things that "stand out".<br /><br />I am having some "<a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_round-ligament-pain_205.bc">round ligament pain</a>" in my abdomen. Essentially the growth of the uterus and the lengthening of the muscles to support it can all create a lot of discomfort (maybe not as much with your second child). This essentially means that every time I move or sneeze or cough I have lots of shooting and dull aching pains on the sides of my abdomen.<br /><br />Sleeping is getting slightly more difficult. I realized a couple of weeks ago that if I sleep on my right side, my arm "goes to sleep" to the point of almost not being able to "wake it up". Then later I read that some major [pregnancy] veins are in your back and that laying on your back or your right side can potentially slow or block blood to the placenta (and apparently my arm!). So I sleep only on the left side now. It probably doesn't sound that hard, but I'm a person used to tossing and turning pretty much all night long - I get sore if I don't change positions frequently. But it hasn't been too bad constantly being on my left. I have a feeling that will all change in a couple of weeks however...<br /><br />Some days are more energetic for me and some days I literally work in my jammies all day.  I am still dealing with depression over my mom's death (obviously - that will be for a long time), so I never really know if it's pregnancy or depression that makes me so "quiet" at one time or another. But I try not to push myself too much and just let the day unfold as it will. Right when I got pregnant, I developed the urge to be alone A LOT - a general feeling of not wanting to be around people or to be on the phone, but just wanting to "nest". It's more of a content feeling rather than a depression thing. But since my mom's death, it has intensified a bit more - I really have to work hard to get myself out of the house and to hang out with people. I was an introvert before but I may as well be out in the country now. Thankfully I am productive when isolated. I never watch movies (or TV since we don't have one), but instead I do all kinds of stuff on the house and in the yard. I certainly don't prefer house work to company, but they are all things that need to be done...<br /><br />I am constantly encouraging Erik, however, to make friends and attend meetings. He's been going to several meet-ups and gatherings lately of folks that have the same computer interests. He's really been enjoying all of the different kinds of meetings and communities that exist, and he's working on creating his first presentation for an upcoming meeting (these geeks are pretty organized!).<br /><br />I have been working on bringing a farmers market to our area. Currently we have to drive about 3 miles to the nearest one, and it's an amazing one - they have everything I need and more. But my goal is to help our own neighborhood become more "self sufficient". We moved here for the promise of how "urban" it was becoming - our house is close to the latest and most environmentally developed  parts of town. And while there are many cool things (the park and shopping), there is no farmers market or [good] grocery store within 3 miles. There is a growing interest in our neighborhood for the market, and our neighborhood newletter called out for others to get involved, so hopefully we will make some headway!<br /><br />Now we are off to our first midwife appointment (the other appointments have been with doctors, but we have stopped those and will only see a midwife from now on). Will report on that next time!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-7045344114313544101?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1234379160;s:12:"original_url";s:57:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/02/19-weeks.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-7045344114313544101";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:18;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:26:"Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Moe...";s:11:"description";s:7290:"Yesterday I finally decided on our midwife. I needed to do this last week (and the week before), but I've just been undecided about who to pick. Since day one we've known that we wanted a home birth with a midwife, but with the holidays and my mother's death, we did not have the time to do many interviews. So we've been getting general prenatal care in the meantime while we interviewed and decided on midwives.<br /><br />The two midwives we interviewed couldn't be more different. One is a young earthy yoga teacher that has delivered babies (and her own son) on dirt floors in Mexico. She's very into the community and has recently opened a hip little office in east Austin that is very close to our house. She's connected to an acupuncturist (more important than it sounds), and she teaches her own childbirth class. She's delivered around 450 babies and is very competent. However, she is all business when it comes to childbirth, and while this works for some women, I think I would like someone with a kinder bedside manner. Her all-business approach seems contradictory to her appearance as a yoga teacher and community person, but that's how she is.<br /><br />The other midwife is a little older and has about 10-15 years more experience and has delivered twice as many babies (and has 4 of her own). Much to our surprise, she is not a believer in yoga and thinks the book beloved by many, "Birthing from Within", is cheesy. Basically, she kicks it old school: "you can do all of the crazy stuff in the world, but that baby is coming out and I'll be here to help you with that". Her bedside manner is much more motherly and nurturing, something that may appeal to me more at the birth than the other midwife's resume. She is not as technologically savvy, and she pretty much works alone (not all involved in the "community" like the other one). But I like that she's confident and sweet at the same time - not as intimidating. She's much further away from us, but they say it's worth the travel to have the midwife that seems best for you.<br /><br />To some people, it's a no-brainer that the woman who has delivered the most babies is the right choice. Others would say that someone who doesn't believe in yoga is a nut job. I thought (and still think) both of these to an extent, but I decided to go with the non-yoga lady. Even though I really believe in yoga and mediation (especially for child birth), it is really her bedside manner that I think will be more important to me during the birth and after. It's not like I'm exactly doing yoga right now anyway...<br /><br />Of course, once I wrote an email to her and pressed send, I started to wonder if I had made the right choice. Maybe it would be better to have the younger yoga-type of midwife that's used to delivering babies on the dirt floor in Mexico; one that doesn't care if I give birth in a birthing tub or on the roof. Or maybe it is better that I chose the older more experienced midwife that will be more motherly (something I'm craving given that I just lost my own mother). I guess we will see!<br /><br />I am excited to begin my appointments with a midwife, and to end the sterile visits to the OB's office. While the particular practice where I'm receiving prenatal care has been AMAZING (3 midwives on staff), it is definitely set up for a hospital birth, one where you labor for hours under a bright light without your midwife or doctor until it's time to push. For me, it seems so much harder to labor in such an unnatural environment as a hospital, and there is so much anxiety around birth there. While hospitals are incredible when you need them, it is not our belief that it's necessary to give birth there unless we have something wrong. And at that point, no problem - we will be there STAT.<br /><br />Some family and friends are nervous about our choice to have a home birth. I totally understand that. But we are more and more comfortable with this decision everyday. While I have now been to a handful of home births already, we are still reading every night about what to expect and how to prepare mentally and physically for an otherworldly experience. I am in no way unaware of how painful childbirth can be, and I know I won't get a medal for going through the pain. But I also know that I will have a calmer experience (hopefully) with bringing our child into the world, and won't be unnecessarily subjected to drugs or a C-section. It is obviously very easy to give into drugs when you are in the hospital and they are being offered to you every 5 minutes. I think it's a great way to go for some women, but it's not really the way we want to go.<br /><br />I wish there were more positive images of birth portrayed on TV and in the media. We are mostly exposed to images of women in the hospital under a bright light, screaming and yelling, saying mean things to her husband and demanding an epidural. Many people are not at all exposed to the beautiful images of natural childbirth, laboring at home surrounded by people you love, and then giving birth on your own terms when your body is ready. In the hospital, there is pretty much a set standard that you need to give birth within 24hrs of going into labor. But some women's bodies labor for a couple of days, stopping and starting again, and this is all very natural. OB's and nurses are wonderful at what they do, but if your labor lasts longer than even 12 hours, they start to pressure you with the options to speed it up or to get it over with.<br /><br />The best analogy I've heard so far about labor and birth is that it's like peeing: it is sometimes very hard to pee in front of people or on demand, and birth is similar - it's very hard to deliver a baby when there's a room full of strangers YELLING at you to PUSH. Just not what I want. But I TOTALLY respect that choice for other women. I respect the choice to want to be in the hospital if something goes wrong, or even just to have access to the drugs. I don't judge other people's birth plans (it's hard enough to judge your own). Women will do what's right for them and that's all that matters. At the end of the experience, we will all have a baby in our arms no matter how we got there.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;">I am realistic that anything can happen and that our expectations of having a home birth might be dashed. But that will not keep me from trying. I am open-minded about what I may HAVE to do for the safety of our baby, but I will strive for what I'd LIKE to do. You can't get what you want if you don't try!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SYr898IQUeI/AAAAAAAAAX8/wXAmHzi5kek/s1600-h/CIMG4393.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SYr898IQUeI/AAAAAAAAAX8/wXAmHzi5kek/s320/CIMG4393.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5299326052597780962" border="0" /></a>Firecracker<br /></div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-2919422375148920875?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1233762060;s:12:"original_url";s:69:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/02/eeny-meeny-miney-moe.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-2919422375148920875";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:19;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:8:"18 Weeks";s:11:"description";s:4644:"I went to my mother's house in Houston this past weekend to begin cleaning out her things, and on the drive back, I dropped "something" under the seat (OK, a Hershey bar) and I couldn't get it... Not because it was too far away but because I have passed a particular point of being able to painlessly bend in half and look under the seat that I'm sitting on. There is suddenly so much pressure and a feeling of constant "fullness" in my belly.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Heartburn has definitely set-in. I used to skip those chapters in the preg books and think, Goodness...I really hope I skip that phase. But no. I mastered it instead. I have FINALLY learned the art of eating smaller meals, and this really helps. Before, I would just be so hungry and so undecided about what I wanted that by the time I ate, I was starving and would end up eating a big meal. Now I try to reach for small things all day, and it's been kinder to me than the big meal. Not being sick has helped this progression.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SYdRNJLu9bI/AAAAAAAAAXk/_vFIgTRXIT0/s1600-h/CIMG4380.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SYdRNJLu9bI/AAAAAAAAAXk/_vFIgTRXIT0/s320/CIMG4380.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5298292772869961138" border="0" /></a>Last Week<br /></div></div><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SYdRNwNkrmI/AAAAAAAAAXs/MuXvwuflOH8/s1600-h/CIMG4376.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SYdRNwNkrmI/AAAAAAAAAXs/MuXvwuflOH8/s320/CIMG4376.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5298292783346658914" border="0" /></a><br />In all honestly, I wish I had my old taste buds back. I need to stop eating some of these crazy things I crave. For instance, when is the last time you had a frozen chicken pot pie? And how many times can I eat pasta per week? Endless. We have really begun to buckle down on our budget, so we're cooking every meal at home. But I am still having a slight aversion to my old style of cooking. No longer do I want beautiful greens and stir fry with chicken. I want comfort food that packs on the pounds (I don't want the second part but it's unavoidable). Mashed (or baked) potatoes, casseroles, hamburgers...things of this nature. Salad is slowly making it's way back into my life - the only problem with salad is that it's not very filling unless there's chicken or something on it. But a preggo can't eat cold ck/meat (and who wants hot meat on a salad?), and I can only have salmon once per week.  And no feta. So salads are kind of lame right now. I need to get more creative with the beans and lentils, but honestly, lentils make me want to puke right now.<br /><br />I'm still figuring out the food thing to say the least. But the overall pregnancy has been a joy and has been very smooth. We heard the heartbeat again very recently and everything is checking out.<br /><br />It's so hard to have those "milestone' appointments and not be able to call my mom and tell her about it, but I still tell her in my heart. The other pregnant woman in my Motherless Daughters support group found out this week that she is having a girl. She is also struggling with going through these huge milestones without her mother even though this is her third child. I am lucky to have found this support group of women that understand the devastating loss of a mother. They understood when I shared how hard it was to clean out my mom's make-up and toiletries this past weekend. With every bottle I threw away, I shook with sobs and sadness. It seemed somehow disrespectful to be filling trash bags full of things she used and loved everyday (hair products, her favorite body powder, thoughtfully chosen lipstick). There is just nothing easy about this process and it's nice to have a safe place to talk about how painful even the smallest of things can be.<br /><br />Erik's grandfather and grandmother said it best in the card they sent: We have been sent a baby to focus our love and attention on. Count your blessings; cherish those who love you.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-8514667138419973970?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1233604140;s:12:"original_url";s:57:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/02/18-weeks.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-8514667138419973970";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:20;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:8:"17 Weeks";s:11:"description";s:5494:"This week I am 17 weeks pregnant. It has been a tumultuous time to say the least. Since we moved here, every second has been busy and I feel like I haven't been able to breathe. It also seems that many of my biggest "life moments" are all happening at once.<br /><br />For instance, we bought AND remodeled our first house. The day I got here, I got pregnant. Then we were busy fixing up our house (painting, tearing down wall paper, buying furniture etc...not even close to done with that...). A week after we moved here, my sister had her 4th baby, and we were scrambling around to help out with that. Then I was tackled with morning sickness, which kicked-off with an exhausting 10-day trip to DC. Then Erik lost his job (and got another one). And then the holidays hit. Trying to earn a little extra money and to help my sister out, I did most of her shopping and all of her wrapping in addition to our own. Then we hosted almost 20 people at our house for X-mas dinner.<br /><br />Then my mom died.<br /><br />With all of the sorrow, grief and mourning that comes with such a loss, we have also been traveling a lot back and forth to Hico and Houston, and it hasn't even been four weeks.  Between renting cars, crying all day and bringing back belongings from my dead mother's house, I feel like I have been hit by a train but am expected to keep going.<br /><br />I also feel like I haven't had any time at all to pay attention to this pregnancy. It has been a marathon of just getting through every day one day at a time, most of those days filled to the utmost brim with other things. And I have to say that I've been fortunate that our little Firecracker seems to be doing OK through all of it, not giving its mama any problems - I am so grateful for an uncomplicated pregnancy, thus far. Now that my morning sickness seems to have vanished, and I'm starting to resurface from the holidays and from tragedy, I am trying to focus more on preparing for this baby. I feel like I lost the first 4 months and there's still so much to do.<br /><br />I wanted to do a better job of tracking all the changes that happened during pregnancy as a sort of scrap-book, but with all of the craziness, I'll just have to try and remember it...<br /><br />I can report that my food aversions are almost gone. I went through a stage of some serious aversions that included doing the dishes. I hated almost all things green (broccoli and green beans were OK), and I hated chicken (after I went through a phase of wanting nothing but chicken). Everything that I thought I would like, I felt like I had to buy in huge portions. Before my chicken aversion, this included chicken soup. I bought huge amounts of chicken and vegetables with which to make huge pots of chicken soup, but once it was made, I couldn't even look at it. Erik ate chicken soup for weeks, and he ate anything else I bought in huge quantities and then decided that I hated. When I was very newly pregnant, I wanted BBQ every single day, and fries, shakes and hamburgers. Thank goodness for this healthy fast-food hamburger place out here called P. Terry's - they use locally grown produce and local meat for their burgers (they even have veggie burgers, not that you'd catch me eating one of those during those early stages).<br /><br />Some cravings that have stuck around are chocolate and lemon meringue pie. Luby's Cafeteria (remember that place?) is my favorite place to eat right now. You can get crazy combinations of food and not feel out of place. I can get a salad with iceberg lettuce (don't ask), mac and cheese, broccoli, fish, pie, lemonade and jello, and no one even looks twice. My craving for the ever-stereotypical pickles has started to chill a little. At first, I only wanted to eat things that I could eat with pickles (hence my hamburger craving). But now I can actually pass on the pickles every once in awhile. Cheese sandwiches with mayo were a huge craving that has stuck around. It used to be that I especially liked grilled cheese, but now the smell of toasting bread in a skillet makes me want to wretch. I still crave a good cheeseburger, though they're not as much fun right now because I have to order them well-done, but they're still good...especially with mayo and pickles (and onion rings on the side...and a shake...).<br /><br />Since we have been on the road and so freakin' busy, I have had my complete fill of fast food. Now that life is hopefully slowing down a bit, I hope that we can get back on track with groceries and cooking (what's that?). After my mother died, my sister and friend were so nice to bring casseroles over that we could freeze and eat for weeks, and these casseroles totally saved us. While Erik was gone for a week in DC and I was completely mourning, I never left the house and ate casserole for every meal. Man, I forgot how convenient frozen casserole can be. Actually, I forgot that casserole existed at all - it's my new fave.<br /><br />We still have a lot left to do on the house, and we have a lot to do with the pregnancy (including pick a midwife), but I'm hoping for some peace so that we can enjoy the bundle that is quietly growing bigger every day. I meant to include a picture in this post, but when I reached for the camera I discovered it wasn't charged.

While my sisters and best friend have tried to fill my evenings, I have all too much emptiness all day and all night. I spend the day working and trying to chase my thoughts away, but no matter what I do, she is there. When I approach the stove to heat up lunch, I remember one of the last conversations I had with my mom when she was in the hospital. For the millionth time, I asked her to walk me through her cornbread dressing recipe so that I could serve it yet again for a large Christmas crowd at my house. That memory hurts for so many reasons that are hard to explain - partly because of my regret of not cooking her a Christmas dinner when she got out of the hospital when she asked me to (I was sick). Memories good and bad flood my mind and I can't seem to escape them.<br /><br />Any quiet moment is filled with her. Without Erik here, I read and read in bed, trying to distract myself to sleep, just to turn the light out and start crying harder than ever. Then I try to read again and the cycle continues.<br /><br />The sympathy cards are piled on my table, and I can only get through one or two a day. I had several of her belongings spread out on the table, things that I took from her house during the funeral: a music box from my childhood, the headband she was wearing when she died, the last magazine she read in the hospital. Some people said it was good to leave it out so that I could grieve her openly - some people said I needed to put it away. I at least wanted to put it all together in a safer place, but every time I approached it, I crumbled. Tonight, I moved it all to a different room as I painfully wept. Something about it didn't feel right, putting the only things I have left of my mother in a different room, but I suppose it will help to not confront her things day after day. It was so, so hard. My next goal was to try and organize that room (the baby's room), but I can't go back in there without losing it. I just can't believe this is all happening.<br /><br />Tomorrow I will visit her grave for the first time since the funeral. Someone asked me today if it was too early. I believe it will be hard to see an unmarked grave without a headstone and with fresh dirt (her headstone isn't ready yet), but my sister asked me to go.<br /><br />After the funeral service at the grave site, we went back to the funeral home to finish-up some things. On the way out of town, we passed the cemetery, and Erik asked if I wanted to say one last goodbye. I told him no, as I thought that I would see a bulldozer shoveling dirt over my beautiful mother's body (I saw it waiting as we finished the service). But as we drove by, I gave a scared glance and frantically asked to turn around and go back.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SW6bwcTZYXI/AAAAAAAAAXA/kMz2e76w6Js/s1600-h/CIMG4366.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SW6bwcTZYXI/AAAAAAAAAXA/kMz2e76w6Js/s320/CIMG4366.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5291337868740485490" border="0" /></a><br />I'm so sad that she never saw the most brilliant collection of flowers ever on her behalf.

When the wind blows strong and pushes your hair back, it feels like someone's touching your face or gently moving your hair around. It is a particularly windy day here in Austin and I feel like my mother is blowing through the trees and moving my wind chime. I fear that if I go outside, I may fall apart right in the yard. Each breeze is like an embrace, and while watching it soothes me, feeling it brings on a deep burning in my throat and heart.<br /><br />It's a week today that I buried my mother, and I feel like time has stood still. While the rest of the world stays on its schedule and rushes by, I feel like I am paralyzed with grief and unable to join the world again. Something about going outside makes me begin to count the millions of things that she will never do again or that we'll never do together: she'll never shop as she used to love, she'll never go out to eat, she'll never listen to the oldies, she'll never see another movie, and she'll never feel the wind. I'll never feel her arms around me again, and she'll never feel my head again when I'm sick. The things I took for granted about her I can now barely utter.<br /><br />Below are some photos of the two Christmases before. She loved to make Christmas dinner and serve it on her best china and on a very dressed-up table. We would work for hours in the kitchen, and I took for granted how much it all meant to her. I will gladly continue the traditions she loved every Christmas.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWfPgRj8QYI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/RVNX49u37uw/s1600-h/cimg2774.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWfPgRj8QYI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/RVNX49u37uw/s320/cimg2774.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289424440746852738" border="0" /></a>2006<br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWfPfjBM4_I/AAAAAAAAAWA/HY42U-SS7HU/s1600-h/CIMG3203.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWfPfjBM4_I/AAAAAAAAAWA/HY42U-SS7HU/s320/CIMG3203.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289424428253111282" border="0" /></a>2007<br /><br /></div><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWfPgKFg0TI/AAAAAAAAAWI/gqtSyUYVfmc/s1600-h/CIMG3206.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWfPgKFg0TI/AAAAAAAAAWI/gqtSyUYVfmc/s320/CIMG3206.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289424438740177202" border="0" /></a><br /><br />This year, she was in the hospital on Christmas day. A huge part of my regret is that she wanted me to cook a Christmas dinner when she got out, but I had a terrible stomach bug and wasn't up to it (I also knew she'd micromanage it and she needed to rest). Instead, I told her that we'd have a huge Valentine's party and to just let Christmas go this year. She had a bad black eye from a fall she took in the hospital, so I didn't even take one picture this year.  I wish I could go back and change it all. Everything is so final. And final is so incredibly painful.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-4436317106643907025?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1231538880;s:12:"original_url";s:67:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/01/its-long-slow-ache.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-4436317106643907025";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:23;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:19:"My Beautiful Mother";s:11:"description";s:7154:"I apologize to those of you who have already read this message in an email. I'm posting it here for my friends and family that may not have heard yet.<br /><br />Thank you for your kindness and support during this time. I appreciate the flowers and plants that you all sent as I know it is very expensive and these are hard times for everyone. The flowers and plants were beautiful and just perfect for my mother - she loved flowers and plants so very much. In fact, her husband suggested collecting donations in lieu of flowers, but I knew she would prefer to be showered with flowers. She would have truly loved the site of all of those flowers there just for her.<br /><br />My mother, Cathey, died on Dec. 30 after years and years of battling sickness. Toward the end, she had suffered strokes and bowel trouble and had pneumonia during this last stay at the hospital which was around 4 weeks long. They had discovered a blood clot in her brain but had let her go the day after Christmas because it did not seem to be growing and she seemed to be improving. While at home for the next couple of days, she ran around the house as usual, cooking, cleaning and ordering things out of catalogues. She was truly glad to be home and out of the hospital. She would lose her balance the more tired she got, and I begged her the whole time to get in bed and stay there, but as soon as I would turn around, she would be up again and onto the next activity. Her balance issues were due to the strokes that she'd had - things seemed pretty good other than that. We even took a requested trip to Walgreen's and we also took her to have her hair done. However, we didn't realize her pneumonia was as bad as it was. Other than the typical shortness of breath while she ran around, it did not even seem that she still had it. Erik and I left her house on Sunday, and she called me in the car on the way home to help her find something she had misplaced. On Monday, I meant to call her after work, but we were so busy getting ready for our California trip for a late Christmas with Erik's family, that I completely forgot. Tuesday morning I got the call. Monday night and Tuesday morning she had been coughing terribly, and her lungs eventually filled with fluid. She begged not to be taken back to the hospital, and while the intention was to take her a little later, she died at home instead, where she wanted to be.<br /><br />I would like nothing better than to report that I expected it and was prepared, but the truth is that I didn't expect it and I wasn't as prepared as I had been in the past when she had been so sick before. There are times in the past when she seemed more sick and weak than this time and I had been more ready for the call. But I was shocked and devastated when the call came, especially just having seen her.<br /><br />I can't express to you how deeply sad I am on so many different levels. She was so excited about our baby, and perhaps that is the most painful part of all - that my children will never know the kind and gentle and beautiful mother that I had. I am struggling a lot with regret regarding my not seeing her enough this year and my own inability to see how sick she was this time. I have the deepest pain and sadness that I ever thought possible. While everyone says that time will heal, for now my every thought is full of nothing but her, and I can't imagine how the pain will subside, but I suppose it will. The absolute only comfort I have is that I saw her before she went and that she is no longer in pain.<br /><br />She wanted to be buried in Hico, Texas where she was born. This is a very small town about 6 hrs from Houston where she lived. We had a nice service for her and the weather was beautiful. She was buried next to her grandmother in the family plot, exactly as requested. I've attached some words about her that I said at her funeral in addition to the eulogy the preacher gave. There are also some photos from a few years ago.<br /><br />Thank you again to all of you for your support during this time. This has definitely been the worst and hardest thing that I've ever experienced, and you all are helping to provide me the strength to get through it. Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZrhe68x8I/AAAAAAAAAVY/W1VSmmfUANw/s1600-h/8x10-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZrhe68x8I/AAAAAAAAAVY/W1VSmmfUANw/s320/8x10-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289033035373397954" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZrhIbAIyI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/YpV7T3y07ok/s1600-h/4x6-6.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 213px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZrhIbAIyI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/YpV7T3y07ok/s320/4x6-6.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289033029333820194" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZrh_NFzxI/AAAAAAAAAVg/ET-Dy7pQgqE/s1600-h/4x6-7.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZrh_NFzxI/AAAAAAAAAVg/ET-Dy7pQgqE/s320/4x6-7.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289033044039421714" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZq9IJNoEI/AAAAAAAAAVI/4KppmCQrc6s/s1600-h/5x7-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZq9IJNoEI/AAAAAAAAAVI/4KppmCQrc6s/s320/5x7-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289032410783916098" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZq88M2SSI/AAAAAAAAAVA/7489XHPN0o4/s1600-h/4x6-4.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZq88M2SSI/AAAAAAAAAVA/7489XHPN0o4/s320/4x6-4.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289032407577938210" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZq8e1Wu4I/AAAAAAAAAU4/2ygNad0MSI4/s1600-h/4x6-3.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SWZq8e1Wu4I/AAAAAAAAAU4/2ygNad0MSI4/s320/4x6-3.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289032399694773122" border="0" /></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/952057894534259836-5954072645384704502?l=building-a-nest.blogspot.com'/></div>";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:15:"original_author";s:15:"Building a Nest";s:9:"timestamp";i:1231448280;s:12:"original_url";s:68:"http://building-a-nest.blogspot.com/2009/01/my-beautiful-mother.html";s:4:"guid";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952057894534259836.post-5954072645384704502";s:7:"domains";a:0:{}s:4:"tags";a:0:{}}}i:24;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:5:"title";s:20:"So Sick. Sick Sucks.";s:11:"description";s:5166:"I have been sick with an upper respiratory infection for a few days, and the crappiest thing about it is not being able to take something to knock me out so that I can sleep. However, I suddenly remembered a natural remedy today that works like magic and I'm starting to feel better already.<br /><br />Fresh pineapple. Something in fresh pineapple (the enzymes or something) breaks up the mucus and helps your cough. After several days of coughing as hard as I can and then laying down only to have both nostrils completely plugged, I can now breath through my nostrils and my coughing is better. We've also been placing a hot wet rag over my eyes that seems to have opened up my nose a bit (at the suggestion of the nurse we called this AM). Also, I was reading online that squeezing the web between your index and thumb is an acupuncture point that can also help to cut mucus if you squeeze for 1 minute.

We've been buying and hanging curtains, changing out hardware in the house and other various things that were put on hold when he was laid-off. But now that we're hosting X-mas, there was a lot of motivation to get some of these projects done. On top of that, I did a huge part of my sister's X-mas shopping (since she just had a baby) and am wrapping most of her gifts (not to mention shopping for our own gifts and wrapping them). The big problem is that I had to completely stop because of this sickness! Erik, however, kept trucking as he proceeded to go to Whole Foods last night and shop for the entire X-mas dinner. He was gone for over 3 hours! Poor thing was so worn out when he got home. Shopping for X-mas dinner is super hard when you hate going to the grocery store!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zIKVkP7I/AAAAAAAAATo/ttHvjZFqXbI/s1600-h/CIMG4295.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zIKVkP7I/AAAAAAAAATo/ttHvjZFqXbI/s320/CIMG4295.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5282708209468194738" border="0" /></a>Erik tackles the lights.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zIjeBAQI/AAAAAAAAATw/qY2Sa6GMdS8/s1600-h/CIMG4302.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zIjeBAQI/AAAAAAAAATw/qY2Sa6GMdS8/s320/CIMG4302.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5282708216214520066" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zJNIr6SI/AAAAAAAAAT4/hOnFLfCQMY4/s1600-h/CIMG4303.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zJNIr6SI/AAAAAAAAAT4/hOnFLfCQMY4/s320/CIMG4303.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5282708227399346466" border="0" /></a>Our first tree!<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zHcQprxI/AAAAAAAAATY/3VhXgWEP_NY/s1600-h/CIMG4270.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XJiKR9ud4U0/SU_zHcQprxI/AAAAAAAAATY/3VhXgWEP_NY/s320/CIMG4270.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5282708197099548434" border="0" /></a>Baskets I've been making for my sister (all local Austin stuff).<br /></div><br /><br />In the middle of it all, we went to my nieces first slumber party on Friday.
